# Vitamin_Deficiency_Detection_System

This project aims to detect vitamin deficiencies (such as Vitamin B, D, etc.) using image analysis. By analyzing physical symptoms visible on human features, such as nail and tongue features, the application predicts potential vitamin deficiencies and generates medical-style reports for awareness and pre-diagnosis.
This project bridges a critical gap in preventive healthcare by empowering individuals to
monitor their nutritional health conveniently and take informed action when needed.
